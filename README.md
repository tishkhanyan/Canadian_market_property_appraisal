# property_appraisal_project

First I've developed a baseline solution that was using a small part of data which wasn't requiring a cleanup. 
Then I've made some feature engineering and data cleaning such that very simple algorithms like linear regressor and random forest are able to train at that. 
This I've called a baseline solution. 
The next step is to develop ranking+NLP-based algorithm and to see how this additional information will improve the results. And if so start a training using also other parts of provided data.
